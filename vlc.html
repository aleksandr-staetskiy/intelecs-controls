                    <div class="product-body__descr">
                        <p>The VLC vacuum loading system is designed to optimally process all requests for material
                            from multiple loaders sharing a single pump. Theoretically speaking, this is the case
                            described by the Theory of Mass Service that provides a number of useful algorithms. When
                            it comes to processing loaders requests, not all of them are equally urgent. A loader may
                            deliver material to a machine running at high speed or may be used to periodically refill a
                            large storage bin. In the first case the request should be immediately fulfilled. In the
                            second case there may be a large amount of material in the storage bin and the delivery of
                            additional material can be delayed. The VLC system builds prioritized FIFO
                            (First-In-First-Out) sequence placing loaders in the service queue based on the time of the
                            request and on the priority of the request. The priority of the request is determined
                            according to the calculated loader throughput and the estimated material storage capacity
                            under the loader. The sequence of loaders in the service queue can be automatically changed
                            by the VLC system based on the most recent evaluation of changing conditions. Knowing the
                            load time of each loader, the VLC system can precisely determine the waiting time for the
                            currently built service queue. If the priority calculation for a newly posted request tells
                            the system that this loader should be placed in the middle of the existing service queue,
                            the VLC system determines the necessary position for the loader and re-arranges the service
                            queue accordingly. The VLC system can independently and simultaneously process a virtually
                            unlimited number of Service Queues. </p>
