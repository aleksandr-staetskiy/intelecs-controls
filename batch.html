                        <p>The dosing algorithm used in INTELECS™ BATCH control system relies heavily on the stability and
                            quality of the “actual weight” feedback coming from the load cells on which the batch blender scale is
                            suspended. The system uses special strain gauge analog inputs to process the load cell signals. It is
                            important to note that the full-bridge measuring scheme provides enough stability in the
                            measurement to virtually eliminate digital filtering we would normally use. In our new Batch Blending
                            algorithm, the increase in the load cell signal processing speed translates into large gains in
                            throughput.</p>

                        <p>Our test results indicate that INTELECS™ BATCH implementation may result in 10-50%
                            of throughput increase on batch blenders with pinch valve or slide gate dosing mechanisms without
                            any changes to their mechanical designs. INTELECS™ BATCH system has been tested with a wide
                            range of materials on blenders that use different physical principles of material dispensing. The
                            control system consistently achieves superior throughput and accuracy working with rubber pinch
                            valves, steel slide gates or vibrating feeders as actuators.</p>

                     <div class="product-body__descr">
                         <ul>
                             <li>Controls multiple blenders - up to 5 blenders, 45 loaders and 3 pumps controlled by a single
                                INTELECS™ BATCH controller. This ability creates a significant advantage if small-size blenders
                                in large quantities are installed in compact cells.</li>
                             <li>A unique 3-stage dosing algorithm that allows the fastest possible delivery of components
                                without compromising the accuracy of each component. A very flexible tuning system allows
                                finding the optimal combination of required throughput and accuracy.</li>
                             <li>A consistent absolute dosing accuracy of any size component within 0.5 grams of the target
                                weight (the presence of a high-quality anti-vibration system in the blender mechanical design
                                is assumed).</li>
                             <li>Fully utilized networking capability: INTELECS™ BATCH system is an FTP server, web server
                                and TCP/IP capable device. Web server is normally configured for control and monitoring of
                                both Blending and Loading systems via a &quot;thin&quot; client (browser).</li>
                             <li>Built-in INTELECS™ Historian logging all batch blender statistics to the local Flash Memory
                                card for the consequent transfer to a relational database.</li>
                             <li>INTELECS™ BATCH is an OPC server and can communicate with many SCADA packages that
                                have OPC client interfaces.</li>
                             <li>Cost-effective &quot;OFF THE SHELF&quot; hardware solution including a powerful central controller with
                                a very fast distributed configurable I/O system.</li>
                             <li>The system code is a combination of ANSI C and Automation Basic easily transferable to
                                virtually any hardware platform.</li>
                             <li>INTELECS™ BATCH is a control system that is &quot;ready&quot; for Multilayer (up to 9 layers) Extrusion
                                Line control. The system determines extruder throughput directly from Batch Blending
                                algorithm that makes it a much more cost-effective than &quot;loss-in-weight&quot; systems offered by a
                                number of competitors.</li>
                             <li>2.5 years in the making and troubleshooting that resulted in about 80 incremental
                                improvement releases. 50+ installations including single and multiple Blender control systems
                                with or without Vacuum Loading option and several Multilayer Extrusion Line packages</li>
